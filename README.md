# Etch-a-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch is a fun browser-based project that offers users an interactive canvas resembling a blend of a sketchpad and the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy. With customizable grid sizes, users can create perfect square grids to unleash their creativity. Using their mouse, they can hover over the grid, leaving behind a pixelated trail akin to the nostalgic drawing toy.

Crafted with HTML, JavaScript, and CSS, utilizing DOM manipulation and Flexbox
